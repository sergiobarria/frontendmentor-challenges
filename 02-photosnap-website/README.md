## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was quite a challenge for me. However, it helped me a lot to practice using the CSS Grid combined with SCSS and flexbox. I used basic HTML & CSS because the project didn't have too much functionality. Nevertheless, this particular project had a lot of parts that could take real advantage from using a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.
