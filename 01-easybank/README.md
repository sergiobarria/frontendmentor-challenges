## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project is designed to help you put on practice some of the core concepts of CSS like Flexbox or CSS Grid. My first approach to this project was to use a Desktop-first workflow, however, after some evaluation of the project and I decided Mobile-first was the best choice.

### Continued development

After finishing this project, I want to keep practicing images positioning. I think this is a core concept of modern web development.
